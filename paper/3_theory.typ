// Define decision environment


Escalation of commitment is one several terms that describe a decision making phenomenon, wherein individual decision makers continue a course of action in the face of a negative outcome #pre_cite(<staw-1981>, prefix: "see", supplement: none).
Negative outcomes conceivably conceptually extend to many kinds of decisions situations, e.g. interpersonal relationships #pre_cite(<rego-2016>, prefix: "see e.g.", supplement: none)@olivola-2018, however, in all the, otherwise quite disparate, strands of research on the phenomenon, i.e. economics, psychology, and organizational behavior, a negative outcome is most often conceptualized as some form of _cost_ and the entire decision making environment as an _investment decision_ #pre_cite(<sleesman-2012>, prefix: "see", supplement: none)@bragger-2003, i.e. "situations in which resources are allocated to one decisional alternative over others" @staw-1976[p. 28].
While this paper is motivated by some of the limitations of those previous approaches in explaining elected politicians' decisions making -- that specifically relate to how investment and returns on that investment are conceptualized, framing politicians' decision making environment in economic terms, specifically as an investment decision, is an efficient starting point.
Moreover, since politicians, like managers, investors, etc., often allocate funds for projects whose outcomes are not fully certain and foreseeable at time of investment, e.g. whether a large construction project will be completed, or whether pension payments to retirees will be high enough to provide them with an adequate standard of living in the future, it will be efficient in general to look towards the well-developed canon of economic theories of decision making for a baseline of decision making under conditions of uncertainty.
Subjective utility theory #pre_cite(<savage-1972>, prefix: "see e.g.", supplement: none) is the workhorse micro-economic foundation for individual decision making under uncertainty.



// Still, exact approaches differ among those literature strands, #cite(<bragger-2003>, form: "prose", supplement: none) synthesize from this disparate research: "escalation of commitment are situations in which there is an initial investment of resources, some indication of nonprofit making and continued investment in the face of negative feedback" @bragger-2003[p. 6].
To give a concise summary of the seminal experiment conducted by #cite(<staw-1976>, form: "prose", supplement: none): Subjects were presented with a hypothetical scenario, wherein they were made an officer of a technology company tasked with, in a first stage, allocating research and development funds to _either_ one of two company divisions and, in a second stage (5 years later in the hypothetical scenario), to evaluate their first-stage decision and allocate further research and development funds, freely distributable among the two divisions.
In the second stage some subjects were informed that the division they had chosen in the first stage was underperforming, others that their divisions performed well.
Though not stated explicitly, but presumably drawing from classical principles of economic decision making, the author states that "intuitively, one would expect individuals to reverse decisions or to change behaviors which results in negative consequences" #cite(<staw-1976>, form: "normal", supplement: "p. 27").
However, he finds, when subjects were informed in the second stage that the department they had chosen in the first stage performed worse than the alternative, those subjects, on average, chose to allocate a sum 25% higher to their first-stage choice compared to subjects that were informed their first-stage choice had outperformed the alternative.
Prima facia, this behavior is incongruent with the basic, both empirical and normative, principles of classical economic theories of decision making #pre_cite(<marshall-2013>, prefix: "e.g.", supplement: none), in particular marginal thinking, i.e. individuals evaluate decision alternatives on the _change in utility_ resulting from that decision versus the additional cost incurred -- previous investment decisions should (empirically and normatively) therefore not affect future decisions.
Subjects who received negative feedback in the #cite(<staw-1976>, form: "prose", supplement: none) experiment violated this principle in the second stage by allocating their resources in a way that does not maximize their return, given their decision alternatives -- investing all the money in the better performing company division would have maximized their return on investment.
Under these basic assumptions, escalation of commitment is an _irrational behavior_, and is referred to as such by most psychologists and organizational behavior scholar who research this behavior #pre_cite(<arkes-1985>, prefix: none, supplement: none)
In his seminal paper, #cite(<staw-1976>, form: "prose", supplement: none), a organizational behavior and management researcher,
