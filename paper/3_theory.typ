// Define decision environment


Escalation of commitment is one several terms that describe a decision making phenomenon, wherein individual decision makers continue a course of action in the face of a negative outcome #pre_cite(<staw-1981>, prefix: "see", supplement: none). Negative outcomes conceivably conceptually extend to many kinds of decisions situations, e.g. interpersonal relationships #pre_cite(<rego-2016>, prefix: "see e.g.", supplement: none)@olivola-2018, however, in all the strands of research on the phenomenon, mostly economics, psychology, and organizational behavior, a negative outcome is most often conceptualized as some form of _cost_ and the entire decision making environment as an _investment decision_ #pre_cite(<sleesman-2012>, prefix: "see", supplement: none)@bragger-2003. Still, exact approaches differ among those literature strands, #cite(<bragger-2003>, form: "prose", supplement: none) synthesize from this disparate research: "escalation of commitment are situations in which there is an initial investment of resources, some indication of nonprofit making and continued investment in the face of negative feedback" @bragger-2003[p. 6]. While this paper is motivated by some of the limitations of those previous approaches in explaining elected politicians' decisions making -- that specifically relate to how investment and returns on that investment are conceptualized, framing politicians' decision making environment as an investment decision, defined as "situations in which resources are allocated to one decisional alternative over others" @staw-1976[p. 28], is an efficient starting point. Continuing a course of action after receiving negative feedback is on its face puzzling. To what extent it is irrational behavior is more complicated. Psychologists call it call it irrational behavior in the sense that it contradict expectation of standard economic theory, here subjective expected utility theory.

Economists and organizational behavior scholars, naturally, consider escalation of commitment an irrational behavior.

Notes:

Difference between status quo bias, gambler's fallacy

Take into account that people need to feel a degree of personal responsibility (if post-hoc rationalization is the relevant mechanism ,"self-justification may similarly depend upon the level of personal responsibility one has had in determining a particular course of action and the outcomes resulting from those actions" ) @staw-1976[p. 30]
