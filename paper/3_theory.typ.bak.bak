// Define decision environment

To give a summary description of the seminal experiment conducted by #cite(<staw-1976>, form: "prose", supplement: none): Subjects were presented with a hypothetical scenario, wherein they were made an officer of a technology company tasked with, in a first stage, allocating research and development funds to _either_ one of two company divisions and, in a second stage (5 years later in the hypothetical scenario), to evaluate their first-stage decision and allocate further research and development funds, freely distributable among the two divisions.
In the second stage some subjects were informed that the division they had chosen in the first stage was underperforming, others that their chosen division performed well.
Though not stated explicitly, but presumably drawing from classical principles of economic decision making, the author states that "intuitively, one would expect individuals to reverse decisions or to change behaviors which results in negative consequences" #cite(<staw-1976>, form: "normal", supplement: "p. 27").
However, he finds, when subjects were informed in the second stage that the department they had chosen in the first stage performed worse than the alternative, those subjects, on average, chose to allocate a sum 25% higher to their first-stage choice compared to subjects that were informed their first-stage choice had outperformed the alternative.
The finding is notable since, prima facia, this behavior appears incongruent with basic, both empirical and normative, principles of classical economic theories of decision making #pre_cite(<marshall-2013>, prefix: "e.g.", supplement: none), in particular marginal thinking, i.e. individuals evaluate decision alternatives on the _change in utility_ resulting from that decision versus the additional cost incurred -- previous investment decisions should (empirically and normatively) therefore not affect future decisions.
Subjects who received negative feedback in the #cite(<staw-1976>, form: "prose", supplement: none) experiment violated this principle in the second stage, as the amount invested in the second stage as they did not change course, even though the additional utility gained from investing more funding in the other corporate division would have been greater than sticking with the division chosen at the first stage.

Since this seminal contribution, a robust body of research has emerged replicating and expanding on this behavioral phenomenon, wherein individual decision makers continue a course of action in the face of negative outcomes #pre_cite(<sleesman-2012>, prefix: "see", supplement: "for an overview and meta-analysis").
Though sticking to a course of action in the face of negative outcomes is hardly a behavior that is exclusive to economic investment decisions, and has been studied in decidedly non-economic contexts such as interpersonal relationships #pre_cite(<rego-2016>, prefix: "see e.g.", supplement: none)@olivola-2018, it is perhaps not surprising that escalation of commitment in investment decision scenarios in particular has garnered considerable attention from organizational behavior researchers, psychologists, economists and political scientists for its apparent violation of basic economic expectations for individual decision making #pre_cite(<northcraft-1986>, prefix: none, supplement: [p. 349]).
// Escalation of commitment is so intertwined with investment decisions that it has been referred to as "irrational" economic behavior by some researchers of the phenomenon @astebro-2007[p. 254]@northcraft-1986[p. 349]
At the same time, in the opening I gave illustrations of two plausible decision scenarios in which politicians might find themselves deciding on whether to commit to a course of action, that is ostensibly suboptimal, where the a priori expectation for them to abandon course would not have been warranted in the first place.
I.e. should politicians be expected to abandon a large-scale high speed rail project, if they learn it is delayed and over-budget?
Consider also the following case:
Decades after a strict drug enforcement policy is introduced, a report on the policy's impact is commissioned by the legislature and it becomes clear the policy was not effective in reducing drug related health issues and crime, and may additionally have exacerbated other social issues like racial inequality.
The release of the report becomes headline news and there is major political pressure on the legislative body to act.
Stated this way, it is not necessarily self-evident that politicians would conceptualize the country's drug policy as an underperforming investment.
For the sake of argument, one could imagine a headline along the lines of: _Country has spent over a trillion dollars fighting the war on drugs -- 50 years later, drug use is climbing again_ #pre_cite(<lee-2021>, prefix: [see e.g.], supplement: none), emphasizing the sunk cost of the investment and the lack of return, presumably increasing the salience of the idea of investment and return in the minds of politicians.
But a politician from a conservative district may still not be sensitive to the news of the negative return on investment, perhaps because a hard on crime and drugs stance has been a successful electoral strategy in their district.
Also, if politicians are not assumed to be rational agents who only seek reelection, e.g. when they are assumed to vote according to their personal moral convictions, personal attributes #pre_cite(<bailer-2021>, prefix: [class, gender, marginalization etc., see e.g.], supplement: none)@bo-2017@chattopadhyay-2004, or role they occupy #pre_cite(<searing-1991>, prefix: [see e.g.], supplement: none) there is also no a priori theoretical reason to expect them to be sensitive to information on suboptimal return on investment either.
// At the same time, in the opening I have argued that some manifestations of escalation of commitment in the domain of politics, i.e. continued funding for delayed and over-budget megaprojects and lack of reform of fiscally unbalanced pension programs, do not fit well into the existing literature, because politicians are not managers or members of the general public.
// I.e. politicians, plausibly, may not perceive a vote on continued funding for a delayed high speed rail project in the same way a manager, or a member of th general public, is usually, normatively and empirically, expected to perceive a superficially similar situation in which they are asked whether commit funds to a suboptimal course of action
// At the same time, in the opening I invoked megaprojects and pensions programs as examples of decision environments that are unique to politicians, in which they are likely not to follow the logic of investment the same way a manager would in the case of R&D investment in a private company, but, in which politicians do appear to be exhibiting escalation of commitment.




// In their meta-analysis #cite(<sleesman-2012>, form: "prose", supplement: none)
// Importantly, something that has not changed all that much in the literature is the experimental setup.

// Due to its apparent violation of expectations derived from basic, classical economic theories of decision making, escalation of commitment has been referred to as "irrational" economic behavior by some researchers of the phenomenon @astebro-2007[p. 254]@northcraft-1986[p. 349].
// Again others have more narrowly referred to sunk cost effects as irrational #cite(<garland-1991>, form: "normal", supplement: none)#cite(<schmidt-2002>, form: "normal", supplement: none)@arkes-1985.

// in all the, otherwise quite disparate, strands of research on the phenomenon, i.e. economics, psychology, and organizational behavior, in line with the seminal #cite(<staw-1976>, form: "prose", supplement: none) experiment, the entire decision making environment is conceptualized as an _investment decision_ #pre_cite(<sleesman-2012>, prefix: "see", supplement: none), i.e. "situations in which resources are allocated to one decisional alternative over others" @staw-1976[p. 28], and as a natural consequence, the negative outcome is most often conceptualized as some form of _suboptimal return on investment_ (ROI).

// The curiosity of individuals holding onto a course of action in the face of negative outcomes conceivably conceptually extends to many kinds of decision situations, that are not confined to _economic_ investment decisions, like the one in the seminal #cite(<staw-1976>, form: "prose", supplement: none) experiment.
// For instance, the idea of escalation of commitment has been applied to interpersonal relationships #pre_cite(<rego-2016>, prefix: "see e.g.", supplement: none)@olivola-2018.

Conversely, legislators effectuate political outcomes by voting on laws, regulations and the budget.
Now, most legislative actions need to be enforced in some way, which the legislature accomplishes by appropriating public funds for their enforcement.
Construed thusly, all legislative decisions could be understood to be investment decisions, following the simple definition "situations in which resources are allocated to one decisional alternative over others" given by #cite(<staw-1976>, form: "prose", supplement: [p. 28]).
That is to say, it is plausible that any given legislator may interpret a decision situation as investment decision.
What, I argue, is implausible, is that politicians think about all their decisions exclusively in terms of investment, and more specifically return on investment.
// Consider also the following case:
// Decades after a strict drug enforcement policy is introduced, a report on the policy's impact is commissioned by the legislature and it becomes clear the policy was not effective in reducing drug related health issues and crime, and may additionally have exacerbated other social issues like racial inequality.

// But a politician from a conservative district may not be sensitive to the news of the negative return on investment, perhaps because a hard on crime and drugs stance has been a successful electoral strategy in their district.
// Also, if politicians are not assumed to be rational agents who only seek reelection, e.g. when they are assumed to vote according to their personal moral convictions, personal attributes #pre_cite(<bailer-2021>, prefix: [class, gender, marginalization etc., see e.g.], supplement: none)@bo-2017@chattopadhyay-2004, or role they occupy #pre_cite(<searing-1991>, prefix: [see e.g.], supplement: none) there is no a priori theoretical reason to expect them to be sensitive to information on suboptimal return on investment either.
To wit, #cite(<sheffer-2017>, form: "prose", supplement: none) provide some _empirical_ indication that politicians could, in fact, be sensitive to information on negative return on investment.
They present a sample of Belgian, Canadian and Israeli lawmakers $(N=382)$ as well as members of the general population in those countries with the following vignette:
#quote[
  Please consider the following scenario: five years ago the government invested \$500 million in a small business loan program to help those businesses create more jobs a program that was projected to fully return the investment. The program is now about to end, and it turns out that after five years, the return has been only [\$300 / \$450] million. That is, [\$200 / \$50] million less than what was originally projected. The government department running the program now asks to extend the program in a year and invest another \$100 million in government funds, in order to assist business facing difficulties returning their loans. The department officials project that by the end of the year, these measures will recover the remainder of the original investment [\$200 \$50]
  million), plus return the additional \$100 million asked for #pre_cite(<sheffer-2017>, prefix: [see online supplemental material for], supplement: [p. 16]).
]
and found that lawmakers in Belgium and Canada, but not Israel, were significantly more likely to escalate their commitment and invest the additional \$100 million, and the difference is statistically significant across all countries pooled together.
One the one hand, from these results we can at least deduce that politicians are more generally sensitive to _negative information_ on a course of action when presented with an _investment-framed_ decision environment, but we cannot know if the decision environment as designed by the authors is representative of politicians' perception of their decision environment, when they vote on legislation.
This is relevant because
// but their experimental setup does not allow to discriminate whether _a negative return on investment_, as compared to a _signal of any other kind of negative consequence_, is the operative kind of signal.
// I.e. would politicians have escalated their commitment if the decision scenario had been framed
// But, since politicians may not conceptualize their actual voting decisions in the legislature they are a member of as investment decisions at all, it follows that, it follows that to adequately address escalation of commitment among politicians, it is necessary to account for how politicians perceive that decision environment.









// As illustrated above, since there is good reasons to believe that politicians may be less sensitive to investment and return on investment related signals, to adequately address escalation of commitment among politicians making decisions that are idiosyncratic to being a politician, it is necessary to control for how politicians perceive their decision environment, i.e. as am investment decision or not.

// It follows that, if, how and to what extent legislators may exhibit escalation of commitment, should, at least in part, be _contingent on how they perceive their decision environment_, whether they perceive themselves to be making an investment or not, i.e. whether they can be conceptualized to be in a decision environment where they are sensitive to information on the negative consequences of a course of action
// One, of course, cannot directly induce politicians to act in accordance with one theoretical framework over another, but in an experiment the framing of the decision environment could be manipulated.
// Assuming the framing increases the salience of on way of thinking over another, one could ascertain whether there is a difference in escalation of commitment between politicians who have been primed to think of a course of action as an investment decision vs. not.

// Per kilometer, a highway may conceivably generate more in tax revenue through the diffuse economic activity it enables than it costs to maintain.
// That is not to say that is always the case, or even as a rule, and we can assume heavy diminishing returns for any new kilometer of highway past a certain extent of the highway network, but it is possible for a road, in this specific context to generate a positive return on investment, from the perspective of legislator.
// At the same time, a road in low-density suburban residential neighborhood, per kilometer will, a priori, never create more economic activity than it costs in maintenance, because it serves an inherently limited number of residents.
// But those kinds of roads are funded and built all the time too, so, intuitively, legislators (granted,  in this case not national legislators) don't
// But both kinds are funded and built all the time,
// As stated above, for the purpose of this paper, even though politicians are not investors, it will be efficient to frame politicians' decision making in terms of allocating public funds, or investing as defined above.
// While this paper is motivated by some of the limitations of previous approaches in explaining elected politicians' decisions making -- that specifically relate to economic theories of decision making and how how investment and returns on that investment are conceptualized -- framing politicians' decision making environment in economic terms, specifically as an investment decision, is an efficient starting point.
// == Esclation of commitment in an investment decisions environment
// Moreover, since politicians, like managers, investors, etc., often allocate funds for projects whose outcomes are not fully certain and foreseeable at time of investment, e.g. whether a large construction project will be completed in-time and in-budget, or whether a pension reform will be able ensure an adequate standard of living to retirees in ten years time, it will be efficient in general to look towards the well-developed canon of economic theories of decision making for a baseline of decision making _under conditions of uncertainty_, which much of the existing research, both economic and psychological, also in some way references.

// It should be noted, due to its apparent violation of expectations derived from basic, classical economic theories of decision making, escalation of commitment has been referred to as "irrational" economic behavior by some researchers of the phenomenon @astebro-2007[p. 254]@northcraft-1986[p. 349], again others refer only specifically to sunk cost effects as irrational #cite(<garland-1991>, form: "normal", supplement: none)#cite(<schmidt-2002>, form: "normal", supplement: none)@arkes-1985, both implying that economic theory alone cannot address the phenomenon.
// In any case, the standard textbook economic decision making paradigm under uncertainty #pre_cite(<mas-colell-1995>, prefix: [e.g.], supplement: none), namely Subjective Expected Utility #pre_cite(<savage-1972>, prefix: "see", supplement: none)@anscombe-1963, does allow for, and has been used to model escalation of commitment in different ways #pre_cite(<sleesman-2012>, prefix: "see", supplement: none).
// That is to say, Subjective Expected Utility Theory does not do away with marginalism, rendering sunk cost effects rational, but it takes into account individuals' _subjective_ beliefs about an uncertain future.
// Since sunk cost effects are inherently fallacious, and therefore irrational, I argue the terms are not interchangeable, rather sunk cost are one of many non-rationalist explanatory approaches for the behavioral phenomenon of escalation of commitment.
// Subjective Expected Utility Theory has many critics and empirical support is mixed #pre_cite(<ellsberg-1961>, prefix: "see", supplement: none)@allais-1953@tversky-1975@friedman-2014, still, it will serve a springboard role for further theoretical discussion.
// To wit, in what follows, decision making under uncertainty according to Subjective Expected Utility Theory will be illustrated in some detail for the idiosyncratic types of decisions politicians face, in order to precisely locate breakpoints of the theory as they relate to other competing or complementary theories and formulating hypotheses for escalation of commitment dynamics for politicians.

// == Decision under uncertainty

// A decision under uncertainty, in a broader sense, is any decision situation in which the outcome of that decision is not deterministic, i.e. there is a stochastically determined distribution of possible outcomes @edwards-1954.
// Some economists then further differentiate uncertain from risky decisions #pre_cite(<edwards-1954>, prefix: [see], supplement: [pp. 390-391]), wherein for risky decisions that distribution is, in principle, observable, i.e. the odds of the possible outcomes can be straightforwardly computed, e.g. a game of roulette, and for uncertain decisions that distribution is not objectively knowable, e.g. horse race betting, what #cite(<anscombe-1963>, form: "prose", supplement: [p. 200]) call a "horse lottery".
// More often than not, politicians (like managers) must make decisions under uncertainty in the stricter sense.
// According to Subjective Expected Utility, under conditions of uncertainty, individuals envision the possible outcomes of their decision situation, or "states of the world" #pre_cite(<savage-1972>, prefix: none, supplement: [p. 13]), to which they assign a likelihood of obtaining, or "personal probability" #pre_cite(<savage-1972>, prefix: none, supplement: [p. 30]).
// Under Subjective Expected Utility Theory, individuals in a decisions situation choose among "acts" #pre_cite(<savage-1972>, prefix: [see], supplement: [p. 14]), or in other words courses of action, which for each possible state of the world are associated with some payoff.
// The total utility of an act is given by the cumulative utility of each state of the world, weighted by its subjective probability to obtain, and decision makers choose that act with the greatest expected utility.
// Below follows a sketch of the two idiosyncratic decision scenarios politicians face mentioned before under Subjective Expected Utility Theory#footnote[In the following section I will employ some mathematical notation for purpose of illustration and conciseness. This paper does not intend to give a full formal logical treatise of Subjective Expected Utility Theory, within this limited scope, the notation will not be rigorous or following any particular convention, rather, where appropriate, it will take inspiration from #cite(<anscombe-1963>, form: "prose", supplement: none) and #cite(<savage-1972>, form: "prose", supplement: none)].
// In keeping with the economic paradigm, for the purpose of the following vignettes, assume voters vote purely economically #pre_cite(<meltzer-1981>, prefix: [e.g.], supplement: none).
// Payoffs can then be conceptualized in terms of votes gained or lost by an act.


// First, however, it will be necessary to establish some basic assumptions of politician behavior.
// For the purpose of this paper, assume legislators' primary rational self-interest is to get re-elected #pre_cite(<mayhew-1974>, prefix: [e.g.], supplement: none).
// There is good reason to believe politicians are not solely reelection seeking, but also have other goals and roles #pre_cite(<searing-1991>, prefix: [see e.g.], supplement: none), but for reasons of parsimony, scope, and the fact that much of the existing literature is routed in the economic paradigm, I will continue with this assumption.
// Future research should revisit escalation of commitment among politicians with the lense of other paradigms.
// In a first scenario, assume midway through construction, the national railway operator reports that the high-speed rail line currently being built will be delayed 2 years and 50% over-budget.
// This first scenario is not dissimilar to the #cite(<staw-1976>, form: "prose", supplement: none) experiment.
// In a first stage, legislators are initially asked to approve the funding and timeline of the rail project.
// The decisions environment in this first stage, according to Subjective Expected Utility, can be conceived of as follows:
// Though there are technically infinite possible outcomes (states $s$ of the world), for example sake we can assume legislators may think of four states of the world: The project is (1) completed on-time and in-budget, (2) completed a little over-budget and late, (3) severely over-budget and very late, (4) never completed.
// Legislators assign each state a likelihood of occurring (personal/subjective probability $p$), e.g. $(60%, 20%, 15%, 5%)$ in order, where the probabilities sum up to $100%$.
// Legislators can choose between two acts $a$: For simplicity sake, assume they choose between voting in favor appropriating the funds (act $a_f$) and voting against (act $a_g$).
// Each act is associated with some value or payoff $A$, e.g. $A_f$ is the votes gained by voting for the project, if act $a_f$ is chosen, and $A_g$ is the votes gained if act $a_g$ is chosen, i.e. the legislator votes against the project.
// Finally, each payoff is assigned a utility $u(A_f)$ and $u(A_g)$, according to some utility function $u$ that is idiosyncratic to the legislator.
// A utility function $u$ separate from the value $A$ is used to allow for diminishing marginal utility #pre_cite(<edwards-1954>, prefix: [see], supplement: none)@savage-1972, or in practical terms, in a 100,000 voter constituency the 50,001st vote gained is more important than the 99,999th.
// The total payoff fore each state is given by @3_rail.
// Note that for each state a legislator gains $A_a$ votes, where $A_a$ is the votes gained by the supporters of the chosen act $a$, and at the same loses votes $A_(#sym.not a)$, where $A_(#sym.not a)$ is the number of supporters of the act not chosen.
// For instance, under purely economic voting, supporters of act $a_f$, approving the project, may include land lords in the cities, which the the new rail line will connect, as they expect an increase in demand, allowing them to raise rents.
// Supporters of act $a_g$, voting against the project, may include airline executives, who expect a new long-distance rail service to cut into their bottom line.
// In those states, in which the rail project is chosen, but is delayed and over-budget, the legislator is additionally penalized (pen.) with losing voters for incompetence, anticipated increased taxes to fund the cost overrun, etc.
// The penalty is accordingly taken into account as additional votes for legislators, who voted against the project (arithmetically expressed as fewer voters lost).
// Finally, to choose among the alternatives, legislators will/should calculate the expected utility of each act, so in this case by $E(u(a))=0.6*u(s_(1a)) + 0.2*u(s_(2a))+ 0.15*u(s_(3a)) + 0.05*u(s_(4a))$, substituting $a$ for the respective act, and choose the act with the higher expected utility.
// Assuming a majority of legislators found the expected utility of voting in favor to be greater than voting against, the second stage, with the news of the delay and cost overrun, can be outlined in a similar way to the first stage.
// The possible states of the world may now include: The project will be (1) completed with the specified delay and cost increase, (2) further delayed and over-budget, and (3) never completed, and a possible distribution of subjective probabilities for one legislator may be $(30%, 60%, 10%)$, in order, with acts $a_(f f)$ voting to continue the funding and $a_(g g)$ voting to stop the project (see @3_rail_second).
// Expected utility is calculated as before.
// Crucially, at this stage Subjective Expected Utility Theory does not strictly necessitate that the project be abandoned.
// Finally, note that, even assuming politicians do not solely rely on their personal judgement for determining the likelihood distribution of the end-states of the large infrastructure project, but seek out information derived from scientifically sound strategies of quantifying that likelihood distribution, reasonable individuals will disagree over the assumptions made in the pursuit of any such strategy.
// I.e. the probability distribution of possible outcomes for this kind of decisions scenario is fundamentally subjective, unlike the probability distribution of a coin-toss, which will always be 50% heads -- 50% tails, or _objective_.

// Without developing the a full formal model, it is clear that under Subjective Expected Utility theory and some simple rationalist assumptions of politicians' behavior, personal probability and the size of the vote penalty legislators assign each state is decisive for whether politicians choose to escalate commitment.

// To form empirical expectations for politicians' behavior then, politicians' process of arriving at personal probabilities and the expected vote penalty needs to be modelled in some way.
// Within this framework, we can differentiate approaches that either (1) aim to explain how politicians tackle the vote penalty and (2) approaches that tackle how politicians may arrive at some ordering of the probabilities they assign different states.



// Relating to probabilities

// Decision risk: Riskiness/Uncertainty of decision increases salience of loss potential to decision makers -> decreasing likelihood of escalation because prospect theory
// Information acquisition: Ambiguous information facilitates wrong probability judgments
// Decision uncertainty: Ambiguous information allows to focus on positive information



// Relating to penalty:

// Opportunity cost information: Opportunity cost information emphasizes utility of decision alternative, reducing escalation, realize the alternative also has voters
// Expressed preference for initial decision: Is almost worth any gamble


// For instance, from a Subjective Expected Utility standpoint modelling the vote penalty can be also be conceived of as decision under uncertainty, i.e. another _horse lottery_, making it a "compound lottery" #pre_cite(<anscombe-1963>, prefix: none, supplement: [p. 200]).
// However, the question of how politicians predict the voting behavior of their constituents is more broad and beyond the scope of this paper.
// Therefore, this paper will further interrogate how politicians come to assign probabilities to the possible outcomes (states) of their decisions.

// Individual decision making is a broad topic and researched, To define escalation of commitment,

// Individual decision making is of interest in most social science, the escalation of commitment literature forms a subset of that field that has been primarily concerned with decision making in _investment situations_. While this paper is motivated by some of the limitations of those previous approaches in explaining elected politicians' decisions making, that specifically relate to how investment and returns on that investment are conceptualized, framing politicians' decision making environment as an investment decision, defined as "situations in which resources are allocated to one decisional alternative over others" @staw-1976[p. 28], is an efficient starting point.
