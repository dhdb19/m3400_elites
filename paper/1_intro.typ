After repeated cost-overruns, in 2023, then prime minister of the United Kingdom, Rishi Sunak announced that the country's high speed rail project High Speed 2 (HS2) would be scaled down considerably, claiming that Â£36 billion in funds would be redirected to other transport projects @Sunak2023. It is not uncommon for large infrastructure to run over-budget @Flyvbjerg2003, but, arguably -- though hard data are difficult to come by -- this was a rare occurrence of a large-scale infrastructure project being abandoned @Cornelio2021, despite funds having been appropriated with cross-party support @Topham2023 and construction having already begun on some parts of the project. In addition to HS2, a number of large-scale infrastructure projects in western developed democracies -- sticking with rail projects Stuttgart 21 in Germany and California high-speed rail in the US come to mind -- have become somewhat notorious for their cost-overruns and construction delays, but, for now, HS2 remains an exception for funds being removed from the project. So-called _megaprojects_, such as these, "are increasingly used as the preferred delivery model for goods and services across a range of businesses and sectors", at the same time they are considered "inherently risky due to long planning horizons and complex interfaces" @Flyvbjerg2014[pp. 6, 9]. Considering this, from a purely rationalist perspective, in the presence of cost-overruns and higher return alternatives, project cancellation should then be the norm, as every additional pound to be spent should be evaluated on its marginal return alone. Instead of cutting their losses, however, decision-makers, here politicians, will often _escalate their commitment_ @Staw1976 --- megaprojects continue to be funded, even if they would have never received that funding, if the additional costs and delays had been known in the initial decision scenario. Now, there is a breadth of research on cognitive and decision biases that lead to suboptimal decision-making, which is, of course, not exclusively observed among politicians who need to decide whether to continue directing funding towards a megaproject. As individuals, elite decision-makers are, in principle, liable to exhibiting choice anomalies like escalation of commitment @Sleesman2012. At the same time, political elites differ systematically from the general population in ways that can reasonably be expected to affect patterns of choice anomalies. #cite(<Sheffer2017>, form: "prose", supplement: none), for instance, point out, elites appear to differ systematically from the general population #pre_cite(<Best2011>, prefix:"see e.g.")@Dietrich2012 and they operate in a idiosyncratic decision-environment, that impacts on how cognitive biases interact with elites' decision-making #pre_cite(<Miler2009>, prefix: "see e.g."). To wit, they find evidence that elected politicians are overall _more prone_ to of commitment that the general population. Still, the idiosyncratic decision-making environment #cite(<Sheffer2017>, form: "author", supplement: none) refer to relates to the mental shortcuts democratically elected political elites may be uniquely incentivized to take in the face of public opinion and retrospective voting #pre_cite(<weaver-1986>, prefix: "i.e. blame avoidance, see"), but the introductory example illustrates that the _content of what politicians need to make decisions on is idiosyncratic_.



Welfare retrenchment, particularly pension reform, is a sensitive political issue, at times having been given the moniker _political "third rail"_ @Neely1996, meaning an issue that can't be touched. Due to their aging populations, the pension systems of many developed democracies, especially those that operate on a pay-as-you-go basis, increasingly face questions of long-term financial sustainability and even insolvency @ssa2024. While attempts at reform continue @Leali2023@Martinez2024, the general relative trajectory of government pension spending has been invariably upwards for the last four decades (see @app1 in the appendix).




For the most part, despite their notoriety, HS2, however, h.

These and other, are often cited as instances of _escalation of commitment_, i.e. continuing to fund suboptimal or failed policies, so that funds that have already been invested do not go to _waste_.

On the demand side, the question of policy stability in the face of more optimal alternatives, especially regarding welfare policy, is well explored. On the supply side, there is the considerable body of research on partisan differences, however there hasn't been

#cite(<Sheffer2017>, form: "prose", supplement: none), for instance, find in a series of survey experiments that politicians tend to exhibit several decision biases at similar rates as the general population. As regards the sunk-cost fallacy and escalation of commitment, however, politicians are actually more likely to exhibit biased thinking than the general population.

#cite(<Sheffer2017>, form: "prose") ask members of different national legislatures whether they would invest an additional \$100 million in a small business loan program, on which \$500 million have already been spent. Respondent are further informed that the program will not cover its cost, unless the additional money is spent (including the additional funds). However, for large infrastructure projects, the idea of financial solvency does not straightforwardly apply, e.g. a high-speed rail project is not expected to pay for itself directly, but diffusely via increased economic activity, emissions savings, etc. This raises the possibility that politicians may evaluate infrastructure programs run over budget differently from e.g. social security programs that run a deficit (like many pension systems do). I therefore ask:

_How does policy domain affect escalation of commitment among politicians?_
