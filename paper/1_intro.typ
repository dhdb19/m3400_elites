with Social Security in the US having long been described a political "third rail" @Neely1996. A number of large-scale rail projects in western developed democracies, such as Stuttgart 21 in Germany, HS2 in the UK, and California high-speed rail in the US, regularly garner negative public attention with announcements of cost-overruns and delays. With the exception of HS2, which has recently been scaled back @May2023, for the most part,


For the most part, despite their notoriety, HS2, however, h.

These and other, so-called, "megaprojects" @Flyvbjerg2014 are often cited as instances of _escalation of commitment_, i.e. continuing to fund suboptimal or failed policies, so that funds that have already been invested do not go to _waste_.

On the demand side, the question of policy stability in the face of more optimal alternatives, especially regarding welfare policy, is well explored. On the supply side, there is the considerable body of research on partisan differences, however there hasn't been

#cite(<Sheffer2017>, form: "prose", supplement: none), for instance, find in a series of survey experiments that politicians tend to exhibit several decision biases at similar rates as the general population. As regards the sunk-cost fallacy and escalation of commitment, however, politicians are actually more likely to exhibit biased thinking than the general population.

#cite(<Sheffer2017>, form: "prose") ask members of different national legislatures whether they would invest an additional \$100 million in a small business loan program, on which \$500 million have already been spent. Respondent are further informed that the program will not cover its cost, unless the additional money is spent (including the additional funds). However, for large infrastructure projects, the idea of financial solvency does not straightforwardly apply, e.g. a high-speed rail project is not expected to pay for itself directly, but diffusely via increased economic activity, emissions savings, etc. This raises the possibility that politicians may evaluate infrastructure programs run over budget differently from e.g. social security programs that run a deficit (like many pension systems do). I therefore ask:

_How does policy domain affect escalation of commitment among politicians?_
