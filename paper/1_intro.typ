After repeated cost-overruns, in 2023, then prime minister of the United Kingdom, Rishi Sunak announced that the country's high speed rail project High Speed 2 (HS2) would be scaled down considerably, claiming that Â£36 billion in funds would be redirected to other transport projects @Sunak2023.
It is not uncommon for large infrastructure to run over-budget @Flyvbjerg2003, but, arguably -- though hard data are difficult to come by -- this was a rare occurrence of a large-scale infrastructure project being abandoned @Cornelio2021, despite funds having been appropriated with cross-party support @Topham2023 and construction having already begun on some parts of the project.
In addition to HS2, a number of large-scale infrastructure projects in western developed democracies -- sticking with rail projects Stuttgart 21 in Germany and California high-speed rail in the US come to mind -- have become somewhat notorious for their cost-overruns and construction delays, but, for now, HS2 remains an exception for funds being removed from the project.
So-called _megaprojects_, such as these, "are increasingly used as the preferred delivery model for goods and services across a range of businesses and sectors", at the same time they are considered "inherently risky due to long planning horizons and complex interfaces" @Flyvbjerg2014[pp. 6, 9].
Considering this, from a traditional economic point of view, in the presence of cost-overruns and higher return alternatives, project cancellation should then be the norm, as every additional pound to be spent should be evaluated on its marginal return alone.
Instead of cutting their losses, however, decision-makers, here politicians, will often _escalate their commitment_ @staw-1976 --- megaprojects continue to be funded, even if they might not have been funded in the first place, if the final costs and construction time had been known to be the actual costs in the initial decision scenario.
Now, there is a breadth of research on cognitive and decision biases that lead to suboptimal decision-making, which is, of course, not exclusively observed among politicians who need to decide whether to continue directing funding towards a megaproject.
As individuals, elite decision-makers are, in principle, liable to exhibiting choice anomalies like escalation of commitment @sleesman-2012. At the same time, as #cite(<sheffer-2017>, form: "prose", supplement: none), for instance, point out, elites appear to differ systematically from the general population #pre_cite(<Best2011>, prefix:"see e.g.")@Dietrich2012 and they operate in a idiosyncratic decision-environment, that impacts on how cognitive biases interact with elites' decision-making #pre_cite(<Miler2009>, prefix: "see e.g.").
To wit, they find evidence that elected politicians are overall _more prone_ to escalation of commitment that the general population.
The idiosyncrasy #pre_cite(<sheffer-2017>, form: "author", supplement: none) refer to relates to the mental shortcuts democratically elected political elites may be uniquely incentivized to take in the face of public opinion and retrospective voting #pre_cite(<weaver-1986>, prefix: "i.e. blame avoidance, see"), the introductory example illustrates that the _content_ of what politicians need to make decisions on is also idiosyncratic: In political elites' minds, large public infrastructure projects are not necessarily expected to pay for themselves directly, in the same way, say, a private real estate development would be expected to recoup its initial capital investment as quickly as possible, rather increased economic activity, emissions savings, etc. are major components of a megaproject's return on investment.
Similarly, political elites may have different outlooks on the financial return of other kinds of government programs, such as welfare spending: On the one hand, for contributory programs, e.g. many government pensions programs, it is easier to evaluate if they are solvent -- does more come in in contributions than goes out in obligations?
On the other hand, despite the fact that, due to their aging populations, the pension systems of many developed democracies, especially those that operate on a pay-as-you-go basis, increasingly face problems with long-term financial sustainability and even insolvency @cbo-2024, contrary to the rationalist expectation, pension reform is rare and the general trajectory of relative government pension spending has been invariably upwards for the last four decades (see @app1 in the appendix).
From an escalation of commitment point of view, it is, again, questionable if politicians internalize and conceptualize social spending in terms of naked return on investment.

Of course, there is a plethora of plausible theoretical explanations outside of decision biases for why some policy or funding appropriation might be maintained or expanded, even in the face of suboptimal outcomes, e.g. path dependency #pre_cite(<pierson-2000>, prefix: "e.g."), or different political economy approaches #pre_cite(<guardiancich-2020>, prefix: [for pensions e.g.], supplement: none), but insofar as politicians are affected by decision anomalies in their decision behavior, it is worthwhile to more closely examine how those who directly decide on the distribution of rights and scarce goods in a political community come to maintain a course of action that may be less than optimal for that community.
// -- still, assuming politicians' voting behavior is affeected decision anomalies do impact their , the literature on escalation of commitment does not adequately address the idiosyncrasies of elected politicians' decision environment.
Escalation of commitment is readily studied in political science, but, it is more often, or even predominantly, studied through an organizational behavior lens #pre_cite(<sleesman-2012>, prefix: "see"). As a result the concept is usually operationalized in terms of managerial performance and investment decisions in a commercial context.
// This paper is interested in politicians' decision making, who effectuate political outcomes via decisions on laws, general regulations and how to spend public funds
One prominent instance of research on escalation of commitment in an exclusively political context has been regarding international relations, specifically armed conflict, e.g. why a conflict is escalated despite bad news from the battlefield #pre_cite(<staw-1976>, prefix: [the Vietnam war being the go-to example, see e.g.], supplement: none), or sunk costs as a tool of international politics #pre_cite(<fearon-1997>, prefix: [see e.g.], supplement: none).
Doubtless, international politics is a special decision environment, in most cases idiosyncratic to politicians, however, it is also usually the sole domain of the executive, usually a small number of high-ranking politicians, some of whom are elected officials like heads of state or government, while others may be political appointees (e.g. a foreign minister) and career diplomats and national security officials (e.g. generals, intelligence officers, etc.), the latter of whom aren't necessarily politicians.
This paper is only interested in elected politicians' behavior, more specifically the population of interest for this paper is politicians who are democratically elected to a legislative body on the national level.
// who achieve political outcomes by making decisions on how to spend public funds.
// Because much of the literature on escalation of commitment concerns itself with investment decision environments, this paper will be limited to politicians' decisions regarding the spending of public funds, as compared to, say, other kinds of laws and general regulations.

Because much of the literature on escalation of commitment is from an organization behavior lens, even studies that set out to more narrowly investigate escalation of funding among elected members of a legislative body, understandably, draw on the established catalogue of, almost standard, survey instruments from that organizational behavior literature #pre_cite(<sheffer-2017>, prefix: "e.g.").
As mentioned above, there are several reasons to believe legislators in decision scenarios may not think in terms of investment and return on investment.
First, even if they are rational utility maximizers @downs-1957, they are not investors, so they may not derive utility form a decision in the form return on their investment, but from making the world a better place, or less idealistically, from being reelected @mayhew-1974.
// Additionally, politicians holding or changing course in the face of negative outcomes conceivably can take different forms.
Take the case that some decades after a strict drug enforcement policy is introduced, a report in policy's impact is commissioned by the legislative body and it becomes clear the policy was not effective in reducing drug related health issues and crime, and may additionally have exacerbated other social issues like racial inequality.
The release of the report becomes headline news and there is major political pressure on the legislative body to act.
Stated this way, it is not necessarily self-evident that politicians would conceptualize the country's drug policy as an underperforming investment.
For the sake of argument, one could imagine a headline along the lines of: _Country has spent over a trillion dollars fighting the war on drugs -- 50 years later, drug use is climbing again_ #pre_cite(<lee-2021>, prefix: [see e.g.], supplement: none), emphasizing the sunk cost of the investment and the lack of return, presumably increasing the salience of the idea of investment and return in the minds of politicians.
A conservative politician from a conservative district may still not view the war on drugs as a sunk cost that isn't generating a return for society, perhaps because a hard on crime and drugs stance has been a successful strategy in their district, or because they personally believe drug use is morally wrong and should be punished.
// Escalating the course can mean introducing harsher sentences for drug offenses or hiring more police and buying more equipment for drug enforcement, inversely changing the course in such a case can mean, e.g., drug decriminalization or firing those police hired for drug enforcement.

#cite(<linde-2016>, form: "prose", supplement: none) conduct an experiment on a sample of Dutch MPs and do present them with some politician-specific decision scenarios, however these politician-specific experimental vignettes are designed more narrowly to test hypotheses on risk behavior of politicians, derived from prospect theory #pre_cite(<kahneman-1979>, prefix: none, supplement: none).
As will be discussed later, escalation of commitment is also usually conceptualized as decision making with uncertain outcomes, the difference being that experimental setups like that employed by #cite(<linde-2016>, form: "prose", supplement: none) ask politicians to chose among different courses of action that have uncertain outcomes, but do not necessarily cover scenarios in which politicians must decide if they should abandon or stay the course, after they are presented with information that the course is suboptimal.
Conversely, escalation of commitment is regularly researched analyzed within a prospect theory framework, i.e. conceptualized as a decision among risky alternatives, in studies with a non-politician population and sample #pre_cite(<schoorman-1994>, prefix: [e.g.], supplement: none), but there has been no synthesis of politician samples that are presented escalation of commitment experimental vignettes that encapsulate decisions scenarios that are idiosyncratic to elected members of a legislative body.

While this paper is motivated by the limitations of previous approaches in explaining elected politicians' decisions making -- that specifically relate to economic theories of decision making and how how investment and returns on that investment are conceptualized -- there is one theoretical concession to the existing approaches that, I argue, is appropriate for studying politicians, which will allow for an efficient transposition of the considerable existing knowledge on escalation of commitment onto the specific case of legislators.
Since legislators decide on laws, and most laws need to be enforced in some way, which the legislature accomplishes by appropriating public funds for their enforcement, this paper will conceptualize all decisions made by legislators as decisions on how to spend public funds.
I.e. legislators will be viewed as analogous to managers in the sense that they decide how to spend scarce resources among decisions alternatives, which I argue this is an acceptable abstraction.
So, prima facia non-monetary decisions, e.g. passing harsher/leaner punishments for drug use or trafficking, necessarily imply the spending of public funds, here via the increased/decreased cost of incarcerating more/fewer people for longer/shorter.
Proceeding under these scope conditions, then, I ask, _how do the idiosyncrasies of legislators' decision environment affect escalation of commitment of public funds among politicians?_
// For the purpose of this paper, I will adopt the two different kinds of decision referred to throughout the introductory example, funding for megaprojects and funding for pension programs, because they capture the kind of difference in decision content that is particular to the context of elected politicians.

In the sections that follow, I will first establish a baseline economic approach to escalation of commitment among politicians, which will server as springboard for further discussion of more interesting empirical findings and other theoretical approaches.

I argue that prospect theory @kahneman-1979 implies some interesting and relevant differences in expectation for different kinds of public spending that legislator may vote on. Specifically, according prospect theory, individuals are loss-averse and will take more risk to avoid taking a loss, so I expect that the framing of the negative consequences of a chosen course of action
Finally I develop an empirical strategy to test my hypotheses, proposing a new survey instrument that is more tailored to the research question.

// Even when #cite(<sheffer-2017>, form: "prose") explicitly set out to study elected elites' behavior, they ask members of different national legislatures whether they would invest an additional \$100 million in a small business loan program, on which \$500 million have already been spent. Respondent are further informed that the program will not cover its cost, unless the additional money is spent (including the additional funds).

// While attempts at reform continue @Martinez2024, again in contradiction to the the rationalist expectation, the general relative trajectory of government pension spending has been invariably upwards for the last four decades (see @app1 in the appendix).

// These and other, are often cited as instances of _escalation of commitment_, i.e. continuing to fund suboptimal or failed policies, so that funds that have already been invested do not go to _waste_.

// On the demand side, the question of policy stability in the face of more optimal alternatives, especially regarding welfare policy, is well explored. On the supply side, there is the considerable body of research on partisan differences, however there hasn't been

// #cite(<sheffer-2017>, form: "prose", supplement: none), for instance, find in a series of survey experiments that politicians tend to exhibit several decision biases at similar rates as the general population. As regards the sunk-cost fallacy and escalation of commitment, however, politicians are actually more likely to exhibit biased thinking than the general population.

// #cite(<sheffer-2017>, form: "prose") ask members of different national legislatures whether they would invest an additional \$100 million in a small business loan program, on which \$500 million have already been spent. Respondent are further informed that the program will not cover its cost, unless the additional money is spent (including the additional funds). However, for large infrastructure projects, the idea of financial solvency does not straightforwardly apply, e.g. a high-speed rail project is not expected to pay for itself directly, but diffusely via increased economic activity, emissions savings, etc. This raises the possibility that politicians may evaluate infrastructure programs run over budget differently from e.g. social security programs that run a deficit (like many pension systems do). I therefore ask:

// _How does policy domain affect escalation of commitment among politicians?_
